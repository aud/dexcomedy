Alerting:
* Ability to set low/high thresholds.
* LOW threshold is hit, what happens:
  * Vibration starts
  * Screen taken over with alert prompt showing you've hit a LOW with the BG.
  * Click button to dismiss.
  * If you're still exceeding thresholds 15 minutes later, realert
  * What happens if you don't click the ack?:
    * Always visually show the threshold screen unless ackd.
    * If no action for 2 minutes, STOP vibration.

Bugs: Charging watch for 2 hours, low alerts build up and get into vibration loop?
